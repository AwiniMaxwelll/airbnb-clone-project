This is an Airbnb Clone Project, a full-stack web application designed to replicate the core functionality of a booking platform like Airbnb. The focus of this project is 
to build a scalable, secure, and efficient application using modern software development practices. 

                                      Project Goals
   •	Develop a robust booking platform with features like user authentication, property listings, and secure transactions.
   
   •	Master collaborative workflows using GitHub for version control and project management.
   
   •	Design a scalable relational database and secure APIs using Django and GraphQL.
   
   •	Implement automated CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployments.
   
   •	Document the project thoroughly to demonstrate planning and execution skills.

   
                                       Technology Stack
   •	Backend: Django (Python) for server-side logic and API development.
   
   •	Database: MySQL for relational data storage and management.
   
   •	API: GraphQL for flexible and efficient data querying.
   
   •	CI/CD: GitHub Actions and Docker for automated testing and deployment.
   
   •	Version Control: GitHub for repository management and collaboration.
